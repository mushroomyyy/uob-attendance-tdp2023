  "description": "Ever wanted to skip class but still be able to get the QR code for class? Not the most ethical or noble project. However, in the case that you are unable to get to class in time/you have no friends/the teachers don't physically check your attendance, you are still able to register your attendance if the instructor has turned the QR code's validity on from the website by selecting the instructor's name, the date and choosing whether if the session is in the morning or afternoon. This format would likely not be changed for the years to come, so it might benefit following TDP batches.",
