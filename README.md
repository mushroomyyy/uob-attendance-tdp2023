# uob-attendance-tdp2023
Ever wanted to skip class but still be able to get the QR code for class?
Not the most ethical or noble project. However, in the case that you are unable to get to class in time/you have no friends/the teachers don't physically check your attendance,
you are still able to register your attendance if the instructor has turned the QR code's validity on from the website
by selecting the instructor's name, the date and choosing whether if the session is in the morning or afternoon.
This format would likely not be changed for the years to come, so it might benefit following TDP batches.

In order for the programme to work,
1. simply head to your Terminal in whichever IDE you are in,
2. change directory (cd) to the current folder (uob...)
3. type in the terminal/copypasta: "npm install react-scripts"  << without the parenthesis
4. type npm start in the terminal
5. Voila! it works! (if it doesn't you can let me know (:)

PS: If you have not downloaded bootstrap/your computer cannot load the bootstrap packages, you might face some errors as well. In that case:
type "npm install bootstrap" / "npm add react-bootstrap"
(for yarn users just change the text npm to yarn the commands are the same)
